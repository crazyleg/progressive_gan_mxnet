# Progressive Art Generator

Project to generate novel art and experiment with growing GANs with MXNET.
Project inspired by NVIDIA's DeepFace GAN.

I plan to use growing GAN approach with a number of hacks and modern tools to obtain new high-resolution art and experiment with it a bit

I'll start with Growing DCGAN architecture and relativistic GAN and progress from there.
